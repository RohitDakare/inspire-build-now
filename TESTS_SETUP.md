# TestSprite Setup & Testing

## ⚠️ API Key Required

TestSprite requires a valid API key. The current key in your `mcp.json` may have expired or needs to be updated.

## Steps to Fix:

1. **Get New API Key:**
   - Visit: https://www.testsprite.com/dashboard/settings/apikey
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key

2. **Update MCP Configuration:**
   - Edit: `c:\Users\Rohit\.cursor\mcp.json`
   - Replace the `TESTSPRITE_API_KEY` value with your new key

3. **Restart Cursor:**
   - Close and reopen Cursor for the changes to take effect

## Alternative: Manual Testing

While setting up TestSprite, you can manually test the application:

## Code Summary Created

I've already created a code summary at:
- `testsprite_tests/tmp/code_summary.json`

This contains:
- Tech stack analysis
- Feature list with descriptions
- File mappings

## After TestSprite Setup

Once you update the API key, you can:
1. Run automated frontend tests
2. Get comprehensive test reports
3. Identify bugs and issues
4. Get test coverage metrics

## Quick Test Command (After Setup)

```bash
# Once TestSprite API key is updated, test with:
npx testsprite test
```

## Current Status

- ✅ Code summary generated
- ✅ Project structure analyzed  
- ⏳ Waiting for TestSprite API key update
- ⏳ Ready to generate tests once authenticated
