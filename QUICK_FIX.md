# Quick Fix for Edge Function Error

## Problem
The edge functions are not deployed to Supabase, causing 500 errors when trying to generate project ideas.

## Solution Applied
I've added intelligent error handling that:
1. Detects edge function errors (including FunctionsHttpError)
2. Automatically falls back to mock data
3. Creates 3 sample projects based on your form inputs
4. Shows a clear message that mock data is being used

## How It Works Now

1. User fills out the form and clicks "Generate"
2. App tries to call the edge function
3. If it fails (500 error), the app automatically:
   - Creates 3 mock projects
   - Saves them to the database
   - Navigates to the ideas page
   - Shows: "Ideas Generated! (Mock Data)"

## The Mock Projects Will Be:
1. `[Your Domain] Management System` - Based on your selected domain
2. `[Your Domain] Analytics Dashboard` - Analytics and visualization
3. `AI-Powered [Your Domain] Assistant` - AI integration project

## Next Steps (To Enable Real AI)

To get real AI-powered ideas, you need to deploy the edge functions:

### Option 1: Quick Deploy (5 minutes)

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
scoop install supabase

# Login
supabase login

# Link your project
supabase link --project-ref uuxlmvpvwdavtftrjzzj

# Deploy
supabase functions deploy generate-project-ideas
supabase functions deploy generate-documentation

# Add API keys in Supabase Dashboard
# https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uuxlmvpvwdavtftrjzzj/settings/functions
```

### Option 2: Use Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/uuxlmvpvwdavtftrjzzj/functions
2. Create new function: `generate-project-ideas`
3. Copy code from `supabase/functions/generate-project-ideas/index.ts`
4. Add secrets: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `GEMINI_API_KEY`

## Test It Now

1. Go to your app
2. Click "Generate" on the generate page
3. Fill out the form
4. Click "Generate Ideas"
5. You should see 3 mock projects created!

## Benefits of This Approach

✅ App works immediately without backend setup  
✅ No errors shown to user  
✅ Can be tested end-to-end  
✅ Easy to enable AI later by deploying functions  
✅ Mock data is still useful and realistic
